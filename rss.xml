            <description><![CDATA[<p>When I developed my first course on social media, I could not have expected the impact it would have on my students and my career.What we now call "social media" began for me in 2005 as #RotoloClass. That was the name my students adopted for the class I was teaching, and what the school could only call "multimedia" since "social media" wouldn't be a thing for another year or so. I could see that big changes were coming -- that's why I created the course -- but I didn't know it was the first college course on Social Media.</p>]]></description>
